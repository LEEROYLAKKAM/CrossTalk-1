\section{Partitioning the map}

\section{Interaction between the front and back end}

Joris and Lewis designed and implemented the actions which are called by the
front end once the user has selected the search parameters.  These were
implemented using Play \verb+Action+s which are invoked upon HTTP requests to
particular routes.

There are a handful of these actions, the most important of which are for
starting the data collection and computing the display data.  When the
\verb+Start+ action is invoked the \verb+GeoPartitioner+ actors are
instantiated and started with the desired parameters.  In order to be able to
display intersections between the requested keywords, we spawned three
partitioners for each user-selected area: one for each of the keywords, and
another for their intersection.  Twitter's search API allows keywords to be
combined with logical conjunctions and disjunctions, which we used to create
these queries.

When it comes to displaying the data, there are two requests the user can make:
they can request either clustered data or squares with opacities.  In both
cases, the Tweet counts for the Venn diagram are assembled and filtered to
whatever square is currently displayed.  The desired data (either clusters or
opacities) are collected and transformed into the format expected
by the front end, and everything is passed to a view which is shown to the
end-user.  There is also an action to refresh the Venn diagram to display the statistics for the area currently visible to the end-user.
