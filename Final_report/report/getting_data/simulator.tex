\section{Data Simulator}

In order to be sure our program would resist to a heavy load of data, a source of locally generated tweets can be used to test this kind of scaling. In addition to the need for a lot of data to be generated, we need the simulation to be as most complete as possible to take into account that some words are more popular than others, and that the emission of tweets with a specific set of keywords is not uniformly distributed.

The Tweet Tester will analyse the TweetQueries and their listeners and extract the list of desired words and their corresponding listeners. For each word, it will randomly assign a number N between 1 and the total number of queries, that will represent the importance of the word. Then, for each listener of this word, it will assign a random number L between 1 and N that will represent the interest of this zone for a given word, in order not to have a uniform distribution of the tweets.

Once this is computed, the Tweet Tester will feed the listeners with tweets containing a random integer for a message. The Tweet Tester will automatically ping itself at a high rate (configurable in the config file), and for each ping ask N times for a random listener to send his L number of messages.
