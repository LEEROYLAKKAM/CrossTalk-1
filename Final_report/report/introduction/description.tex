\section{Description}

The goal of the project is to create a minimalistic tool allowing users to select trends, display them on a map in real-time, and try to see who speaks about multiple trends. 
A web application based on Play Framework \cite{play} is the solution chosen since it fulfils needs of this purpose (tweets collecting, results computation, displaying, ...). The implementation consists of Scala, JavaScript, HTML codes.
From the user point of view, it is possible to tape keywords, translate them and find synonyms, define areas on the world map and then launch the search. Once the search has been launched, results can be dynamically displayed on the map for the selected areas. Displays can be either clusters or tweeting activity along Venn diagram.
