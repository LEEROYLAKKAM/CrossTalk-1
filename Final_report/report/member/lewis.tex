During the first phase, I worked on the design and implementation of the map
partitioning with Adrien.  This part was done using Akka, as described in
section \ref{sec:partitioning}, so I spent some time getting familiar with the
Play Framework and Akka beforehand.  I then designed the custom clustering
algorithm described in section \ref{sec:agg_clustering} with Adrien, and
contributed to the start of its implementation.  During the final phase, I
implemented the task controller which ties together the user interface and the
Twitter API queries with Joris, as described in section
\ref{sec:task_controller}.  This required careful consideration of the possible
errors that could arise during the task, and some restructuring of the back end
to ensure that the many different actors in the system would synchronize
properly.
