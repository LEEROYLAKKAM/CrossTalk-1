\section{Lewis Brown}

During the first phase, Lewis worked on the design and implementation of the
map partitioning.  This part was done using Akka, as described in section
\ref{sec:partitioning}.  He then helped design the custom clustering algorithm
described in section \ref{sec:agg_clustering}.  During the final phase, he
worked on the task controller which ties together the user interface and the
Twitter API queries, as described in section \ref{sec:task_controller}.
