\section{Cédric Bastin}

During the whole project Cédric was working on the front end for the map visualization. Finding out how the PolyMaps library works as well as debugging javascript. One of the main issues was the visualization of geometrical objects on the map. In the later phases he also worked on the templates which ensure the interoperability with the Scala code.
