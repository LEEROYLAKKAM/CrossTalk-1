During the two phases of the project I was working on the front end for the map visualization; finding out how the PolyMaps library works as well as implementing our corresponding javascript code. In the beginning I worked with Kevin in parallel to find the features we needed and then we merged our work together. My main personal issues with this part was to figure out how to use the PolyMaps library and to debug javascript in general, which, due to it's dynamic design, can only be done by re-running the project or smaller tests. As described earlier, the visualization of circles on the map was also quite tricky, luckily Adrien took some time to implement this feature such that the nice clustering visualization was made possible! In the later phases I also worked on the templates which ensure the interoperability of the front end with the server-side Scala code.
