During the first phase, I worked on finding ways to visualize the data (different types of graphs). Once the venn diagram was the solution retained, I worked on implementing it with d3.js and solved the problem of optimizing the placement of the circles. I also worked on some of the structure of play (views, routes, controllers) and drawed the initial concept design for the website as a workflow.\\
During the second phase, I integrated the venn diagram into the project using Play and worked on designing and implementing the website with Pierre, as well as some other tasks such as drawing a workflow for the whole process of the tweet aggregator.
