During the first phase, I worked on finding ways to visualize the data (different types of graphs), and I implemented the venn diagram. I also worked on some of the structure of play (views, routes, controllers) and drawed the initial concept design for the website as a workflow. During the second phase, I integrated the venn diagram to Play and worked on designing and implementing the website with Pierre, as well as some other tasks such as drawing a workflow for the whole process of the tweet aggregator.
