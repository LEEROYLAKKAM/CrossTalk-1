\section{K\'{e}vin Serrano}

During the first phase, I was working on the map display with C\'{e}dric, as we tried to figure out what was the best way to accomplish our purpose. Then I implemented part of the code and managed to draw circles on an other map using Geojson, but after spending so much time to try to figure out how to draw these circles on our map with Geojson, it was decided to use only rectangles. The circle were added in the final phase with only svg components. I also implemented the part for storing data we needed for phase 2 such as coordinates. When the map was operational, it was ready for the integration with play (phase 2).\\
Phase 2 : during the second phase, I successfully integrate the map with the play framework, managed to get the coordinates of the regions from Scala in order to let the server process the data. This was done using a form and Json format. I also tried to display regions on the map, and with C\'{e}dric we finally draw the regions correctly, so with the play integration it was then easy to pass the result to the drawing functions to get the result.\\
Finally I implemented the part where the Venn diagram is calculated based on the view of the map, that means the border of the map are relevant to compute the Venn diagram.
