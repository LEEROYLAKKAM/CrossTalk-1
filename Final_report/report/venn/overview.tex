\section{Overview}
The goal is to create a visualization of the result of the tweet gathering according to the keywords. Since we want to see the intersections between different keywords, it was decided that venn diagrams would be ideal for that task.\\
A Venn diagram or set diagram is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of sets. The challenges implementing such diagrams is, first, to manage the placement of the circles in relation to each others. Secondly, we need to scale it for possibly up to ten keywords, which also brings optimization problems such as to where place so many circles and intersections automatically.\\
