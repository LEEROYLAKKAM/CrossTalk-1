\section{D3.js and placement optimization}
D3.js is the tool that was used to create the venn diagram, as it allows to do that easily. The main problem was to make the positionning of the circles to be dynamic, and scale with more than two circles (even if it was not used in the end). To do this, the free library of Ben Frederickson was used, which implements the automatic placement of the circles using different optimization techniques, given sets of size of circles, size of the intersections.\\
