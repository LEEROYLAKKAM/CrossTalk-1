During the first phase, I worked on finding ways to visualize the data, in which I considered multiple types of graphs, such as venn diagrams and chords diagrams. Once the venn diagram was the solution retained, I worked on implementing it with d3.js and solved the problem of optimizing the placement of the circles, finding in the process a very useful library (venn.js). I also worked on some of the structure of play (designing and creating first versions of views, routes, controllers) and drawed the initial concept design for the website as a workflow.\\
During the second phase, I finalized and integrated the venn diagram into the project using Play and worked on designing and implementing the website with Pierre, as well as some other tasks such as drawing a workflow for the whole process of the tweet aggregator.
