During the first phase, I equally worked with Timo on the Translation part (section \ref{sec:translation}) of the project using Globse API \cite{globse}. This choice has been made after some searches for other solutions such that Google API, Yandex translate API and even parsing Google translate web application results.
Then we faced troubles with the lack of documentation even with Globse API than Scala libraries (like Dispatch). We finally solved the issue by mixing Play Framework's functions with Apache's framework.\\
During the second phase, I worked with Lewis on the gathering part that consists in establishing the link between Twitter search API and GUI (section \ref{sec:task_controller}). We had to obtain data from the interface, launch all queries requested, collect the results and compute outputs for the interface. This work implied to deal with different structure of the code, correct some parts and bind them together.\\
I also took part in code debugging, report writing and proofreading.\\
