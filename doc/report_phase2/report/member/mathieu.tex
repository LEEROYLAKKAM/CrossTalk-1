\section{Mathieu Demarne}

I proposed the idea and was the team leader of the project. I did the setup on Git, making the skeleton of the Play Framework. I also organized the various subparts and scheduled our weekly meeting.\\
During the first phase, I tested the various Twitter API to find the more suited ones for our needs, implemented the Tweet Manager, the Tweet Searcher and the Duplicate Checker, while Clement was doing the Tweet Streamer. I ensured that our data source was stable and working for runs over a large period of time. \\
During the second phase, I was responsible for the general integration of the various parts withing the Play Framework. I also helped Adrien debugging the Clustering Algorithm and did a couple of tests to check that our system was scaling. I integrated the maps developed by Cedric, Kevin and Adrien to the design generated by Pierre and Gianni to have a coherent platform. I also helped Timo debugging a bit of Javascript. \\
Being responsible for the quality checked, I supervised and checked most of the parts of the project and coordinated the team. \\
On the last week I generated examples for the in-class demonstration.
