During the first part of the project I looked for an API in order to improve and enlarge the proposition of synonym. I found Big Huge Thesaurus \cite{BGT}, a very simple API for retrieving the synonyms for any word in english. After testing and combining this API with the one found by Timo and Joris, we decided to not add the API.\\
In the second part of the project I made research in order to find a suit clustering algorithm, I proposed the SLIC clustering algorithm,  a K-mean based algorithm as explain in \ref{sec:K-M_clustering}. Finally I was actively involve in the design of the web-site with Gianni.
