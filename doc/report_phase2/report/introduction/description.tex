\section{Description}

The goal of the project was to create a minimalistic tool allowing users to select two topics, display the related Twitter activity on a map in real-time, and discover the trends linked to the given keywords. 
A web application based on the Play Framework \cite{play} is the solution chosen since it fulfils the needs of this purpose (tweet collecting, result computation and display, ...). The implementation consists of Scala and JavaScript code and HTML for the UI.
From the user's point of view, it is possible to input two keywords, translate them and find synonyms, define areas on the world map and then launch the search. Once the search has been launched, results can be dynamically displayed on the map for the selected areas. Displays can be either clusters or tweeting activity along with the corresponding Venn diagram.
