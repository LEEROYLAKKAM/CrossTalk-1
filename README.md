===============
The project TweetAggregator is an aggregator allowing intersections of populations of tweets speaking about various subject over geographic areas. It has been renamed to Crosstalk at the end of the phase#2 of its development. This project is the result of the course 'Big Data' 2014 given by Prof. C. Koch at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), Switzerland.

The resulting application offers the possibility to display for a specific area the correlation between tweets according to two keywords.

For more details see the [wiki](https://github.com/TweetAggregator/TweetAggregator/wiki/).

#### Tweets at SF comparating keywords: "steak" and "vegan"

The question we tried to answer here was: 'Are downtown inhabitants more vegan?'

Steak:

Vegan:

Downtown inhabitants speak less about steak.
